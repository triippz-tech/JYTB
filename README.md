## Basic Overview

**Note:** *This project was made for educational purposes. I am not liable for anything you decide to do with this bot*. 

JYTB is a multi-threaded Java application, which "views" a given YouTube video. The bot auto-rotates proxies if a proxy
has been determined to be dead, compromised, or the bot has finished watching the video. The goal is to provide unique 
views to a YouTube video.
